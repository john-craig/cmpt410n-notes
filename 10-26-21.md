## Server Hardening
To improve the security of an organization, policies should be set up to ensure that users must change their passwords on a frequent basis, and so
that they can reuse the same passwords.

There are many suggested guidelines for the policies and settings which should be put in place on a server to ensure it is relatively secure. These
guidelines are provided by both Microsoft itself as well as third-party companies, and even the government. There are also tools provided which auto-
-matically check that these guidelines are being followed on a given machine.

In some situations it is necessary to a company to adhere to a certain standard for the security settings it implements. These settings can be as specific
as the types of encrytion used to store passwords.
