## DHCP Servers

Server Manager -> Dashboard -> Tools -> DHCP

Action -> New Scope 

​	Set the name and description of the Scope

​	Set the base range which is being given out

​	Set excluded range(s)

​	Set the lease duration

​	Configure the DHCP Options

​		Set the Default Gateway

​		Add any additional DNS Servers

​		Set a WINS server (optional)

**EPIPA Address:** this is an IP address which is generated based on MAC address and other information. It is used when there internet/network connection but there is no DHCP server available to provide an IP address. It always begins with *169.254.X.X*.

## Special Shares

Server Manager -> Dashboard -> Tools -> Computer Management -> Storage -> Disk Management

## Permissions

### Share Permissions

Can set the groups which have access to a given share, and what the permissions for those can be. These permissions include:

- *Full Control*: allows a person to modify the permissions on the file
- *Change*: which can modify and delete the file
- *Read*: which can read, access and execute the file

Both of these permissions can be set to either "Allow" or "Deny". "Deny" will always take precedence in the situation where a person is a member of multiple groups with multiple conflicting permissions.

### File Permissions

Files will normally inherit their permissions from their parent folder. It is possible to disable inheritance for files and folders; when doing so there are two options:

- Convert permissions to explicit
- Remove all current permissions

Doing the latter will remove one's own permission to the file/folder, so be wary of this.

Options for this:

- *Write*: can create files (but not modify)
- *Read*: can read the contents of a file
  - can still read the contents even without the list folder contents permission if one knows the path
- *List folder contents*: lists the contents of the file.
- *Read & execute*: can also execute in addition to read
- *Modify*: can change or delete the file
- *Fully control*: can change permissions

### Groups

- Domain Users: actual living people on the domain

**Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)**

*RAID is not a backup*

RAID-0: Writes blocks across disks (striping); cycles through the disks as it writes blocks for data. Faster for writing, slower for reading.

RAID-1: Duplicates data across pairs of drives as the blocks are written, while also striping.

RAID-5: Requires at least four drives. Stripes the data blocks across drives while also striping a checksum for that block on the next drive over. This allows blocks from a lost drive to be rebuilt using the checksum which are stored on another drive.

RAID-6: This writes pairs of check bits on the next two drives over, similar to RAID-5.
