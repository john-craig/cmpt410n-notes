# Systems Administration 9/7/21
There are multiple tools for managing virtual machines in Windows.
 - vCenter is an application installed on a server to centrally manage VMs and ESXI hosts
 - vSphere is an application installed on a desktop/laptop in order to access vCenter

### Virtualization options:
 - ESXi
 - Hyper-V

### Operating Systems
The most recent operating system for Windows virtual machines is Windows Server 2016.

Windows Server 2016 is intended to be accessed with remote tools, which makes it ideal for running inside
of a VM, rather than on physical hardware. There are two major versions:
 - Standard, which is intended for physical installations
 - Data Center, which is meant for virtual installations

There are also many minor versions, such as:
 - Essentials
 - Multipoint Premium
 - Storage
 - Hyper-V

There are many Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows Server 2016, including ADAC, DHCP, and DNS.
