# Systems Administration Notes 10/19/21
Group Policy objects can be used to determine the priviledges and settings for entire groups. These groups can then be applied to entities like users and
computers so that those priviledges and settings are active for them.

Group policies make it simpler to determine default settings for large classifications of employees in an organization, or for entire categories of
devices such as printers.

Group policies make it possible to change the priviledges or settings for an entire organizational category or unit by changing the policy associated
with that group, rather than needing to go through and change the policies of each individual member of the group.
