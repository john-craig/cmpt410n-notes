## File Servers and IIS
File servers are used to store and provide resources for clients on a network. File servers are typically set up using large numbers of hard drives, 
and there are many different approaches to providing redundancy for these hard drives. These are collectively called RAID, or Redundant Arrays of
Independent Disks. Types of RAID includes:

- RAID 0: in which data is "striped" across multiple disks rather than being stored across disks sequentially. This does not actually provide
any redundancy, but does improve reading times.
- RAID 1: in which striped data is repeated on the next disk over in addition to the disk on which it is being stored. This provides one degree
of redundancy, allowing one disk to fail while the data for the system is still recoverable. However, it halves the overall amount of data which
can be stored.
- RAID 5: this is similar to RAID 0, however when striping data there are also parity bits stored for each "stripe" of data. This makes it possible
to know if a piece of data has been corrupted by checking it against its parity bits and potentially recover it if it has.
- RAID 6: this uses both the parity-bit striping of RAID 5 and the actual replication of data in RAID 1

RAID is not a backup.
