## Project
Project To Do's:
 - create server for hosting the webserver
 - install Git, NodeJS, Docker and Nginx in the webserver
 - finish any remaining development activity for web page
 - set up nightly rebuild for Docker container target
 - expose webserver onto public IP address
 - configure Nginx to host application page on IP address


Nope. I have no idea what it is, but it looks like I can use a Linux server.

Overview:
 
 Using snapshots to reuse server configurations

 Install Active Directory et al (2nd or third week)
 
 Set up a certificate server, hardening, quick IIS (last week)

Journals are due Week 14ish... which is 11-31-21.

## Configuring Ubuntu
Had to go onto the VM settings and change it to the "VM Network".

In the Ubuntu network settings I had to set the IP address to 10.11.13.70, default gateway to 10.11.13.1, and DNS to 8.8.8.8

It's possible I also had to use `ip link` to display the available ethernet adapters and... some other command to turn it on.
